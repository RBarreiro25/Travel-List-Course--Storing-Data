Welcome to your on-line travel list!

My goal with this project is to pratice and learn some Javascript skills.

You can interact with it adding or removing some itens for your travel bag. When you do that, the itens are saved dynamically and can be changed as you change the list. Try it!

To do so:

Digit the item name, specify the quantity and click on "adicionar" to add the item; Click on "X" to remove it.

Hope you like it! Don't forget to check my interactive on-line resume (https://raphael-barreiro.vercel.app). 

Feel free to contact me anytime.
